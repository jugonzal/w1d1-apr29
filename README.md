# First breakout
## Dev Workflow with git

First lecture for the April 29 cohort

Some things we are going to cover today:

- State a new problem
- Write code
- get it to Github

Our project is going to be a Password Analyzer. It is a piece of software that checks if your password is strong enough.

- Make sure your password is long enough: 9 characters
- It has upper case and lower case
- it has special symbols
- it has numbers
- not common words (i.e. NOT "password")
- if not strong enough suggest a better one.
