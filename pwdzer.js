// we should ask for a password

var password = process.argv[2]

console.log(password)

// - Make sure your password is long enough: 9 characters
// - It has upper case and lower case
// - it has special symbols
// - it has numbers
// - not common words (i.e. NOT "password")
// - if not strong enough suggest a better one.
